When running tests in this codebase:

1. Use the following pytest flags to prevent early exit issues and ensure complete test output:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --capture=tee-sys
   ```

2. These flags help in the following ways:
   - `-v`: Verbose output
   - `--tb=short`: Short traceback format
   - `--capture=tee-sys`: Proper output capture that prevents early termination

3. This is particularly important for async tests and tests involving API calls or event loops.

4. If you need to debug a specific test, you can run it in isolation:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/path_to_test.py::test_name -v --tb=short --capture=tee-sys
   ```

Remember to use these flags when running tests to ensure reliable test execution and complete output.
