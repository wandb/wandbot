When running tests in this codebase:

# Testing
1. Use the following pytest flags to prevent early exit issues and ensure complete test output:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --capture=tee-sys
   ```

2. These flags help in the following ways:
   - `-v`: Verbose output
   - `--tb=short`: Short traceback format
   - `--capture=tee-sys`: Proper output capture that prevents early termination

3. This is particularly important for async tests and tests involving API calls or event loops.

4. If you need to debug a specific test, you can run it in isolation:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/path_to_test.py::test_name -v --tb=short --capture=tee-sys
   ```

Remember to use these flags when running tests to ensure reliable test execution and complete output. 

# Using Weave to analyze logged inputs and outputs

The Weave api can be used to analyze logged inputs and outputs. Here is an example of iterating over the 
input documents to this call and extracting the ids.

Search the Weave documentation for more information on how to use the Weave api.

```python
import weave
client = weave.init("wandbot/wandbot-dev")
candidate_call = client.get_call("0194b427-ba78-77f3-9989-222419262817")
final_candidate_ids = [doc.metadata["id"] for doc in candidate_call.inputs["inputs"].documents]
```
