# wandbot

Wandbot is a question-answering bot designed specifically for Weights & Biases [documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/).
Leveraging the power of [llama-index](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and OpenAI's [gpt-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), it provides precise and context-aware responses
using a combination of [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for RAG and OpenAI's [gpt-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) for generating responses.


## Features

- Wandbot employs Retrieval Augmented Generation with a [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) backend, ensuring efficient and accurate responses to user queries by retrieving relevant documents.
- It features periodic data ingestion and report generation, contributing to the bot's continuous improvement. You can view the latest data ingestion report [here](https://wandb.ai/wandbot/wandbot-dev/reportlist).
- The bot is integrated with Discord and Slack, facilitating seamless integration with these popular collaboration platforms.
- Performance monitoring and continuous improvement are made possible through logging and analysis with Weights & Biases Tables. Visit the workspace for more details [here](https://wandb.ai/wandbot/wandbot_public).
- Wandbot has a fallback mechanism for model selection, which is used when GPT-4 fails to generate a response.
- The bot's performance is evaluated using a mix of metrics, including retrieval accuracy, string similarity, and the correctness of model-generated responses.
- Curious about the custom system prompt used by the bot? You can view the full prompt [here](data/prompts/chat_prompt.json).

## Installation

The project is built with Python version `>=3.10.0,<3.11` and utilizes [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing dependencies. Follow the steps below to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wandb/wandbot.git
pip install poetry
cd wandbot
poetry install --all-extras
# Depending on which platform you want to run on run the following command:
# poetry install --extras discord # for discord
# poetry install --extras slack # for slack
# poetry install --extras api # for api
```

## Usage

### Data Ingestion

The data ingestion module pulls code and markdown from Weights & Biases repositories [docodile](https://github.com/wandb/docodile) and [examples](https://github.com/wandb/examples) ingests them into vectorstores for the retrieval augmented generation pipeline.
To ingest the data run the following command from the root of the repository
```bash
poetry run python -m src.wandbot.ingestion
```
You will notice that the data is ingested into the `data/cache` directory and stored in three different directories `raw_data`, `vectorstore` with individual files for each step of the ingestion process.
These datasets are also stored as wandb artifacts in the project defined in the environment variable `WANDB_PROJECT` and can be accessed from the [wandb dashboard](https://wandb.ai/wandb/wandbot-dev).

#### Custom Dataset

To run the Data Ingestion with a custom dataset you can use the following command:

```bash
poetry run python -m src.wandbot.ingestion --custom --custom_dataset_config_yaml <path_to_yaml>
```

where

- `--custom` -> Flag for ingesting a custom dataset. If this flag is not set, the default wandbot data flow is used.
- `--custom_dataset_config_yaml` -> Path to the custom dataset config yaml file. An example is provided in `src/wandbot/ingestion/custom_dataset_config.yaml`

The YAML is structured as follows:
```yaml
- CustomConfig:
    name: "custom_store"
    data_source:
      remote_path: "https://docs.wandb.ai/"
      repo_path: "https://github.com/wandb/docodile"
      base_path: "docs"
      file_pattern: "*.md"
      is_git_repo: true
    language: "en"
    docstore_dir: "custom_store_en"
```

### Running the Q&A Bot

Before running the Q&A bot, ensure the following environment variables are set:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY
COHERE_API_KEY
SLACK_EN_APP_TOKEN
SLACK_EN_BOT_TOKEN
SLACK_EN_SIGNING_SECRET
SLACK_JA_APP_TOKEN
SLACK_JA_BOT_TOKEN
SLACK_JA_SIGNING_SECRET
WANDB_API_KEY
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
COHERE_API_KEY
WANDBOT_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
WANDB_TRACING_ENABLED="true"
WANDB_PROJECT="wandbot-dev"
WANDB_ENTITY="wandbot"
```

Note, ensure that you have a git identity file which points to the credentials created for ssh access to repositories. The git identity file is typically located located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and the corresponding public key should be added to the github account.

Once these environment variables are set, you can start the Q&A bot application using the following commands:

```bash
(poetry run uvicorn wandbot.api.app:app --host="0.0.0.0" --port=8000 > api.log 2>&1) & \
(poetry run python -m wandbot.apps.slack -l en > slack_en_app.log 2>&1) & \
(poetry run python -m wandbot.apps.slack -l ja > slack_ja_app.log 2>&1) & \
(poetry run python -m wandbot.apps.discord > discord_app.log 2>&1)
```

For more detailed instructions on installing and running the bot, please refer to the [run.sh](./run.sh) file located in the root of the repository.

Executing these commands will launch the API, Slackbot, and Discord bot applications, enabling you to interact with the bot and ask questions related to the Weights & Biases documentation.

#### Custom Dataset

To load an index based on the custom dataset as defined above, you can set the following environment variable to an artifact path:

```bash
WANDB_INDEX_ARTIFACT="{ENTITY}/{PROJECT}/custom_index:latest" 
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the Q&A bot, the provided evaluation script (â€¦) can be used. This script utilizes a separate dataset for evaluation, which can be stored as a W&B Artifact. The evaluation script calculates retrieval accuracy, average string distance, and chat model accuracy.

The evaluation script downloads the evaluation dataset from the specified W&B Artifact, performs the evaluation using the Q&A bot, and then logs the results, such as retrieval accuracy, average string distance, and chat model accuracy, back to W&B. The logged results can be viewed on the W&B dashboard.

To run the evaluation script, use the following commands:

```bash
cd wandbot
poetry run python -m eval
```
