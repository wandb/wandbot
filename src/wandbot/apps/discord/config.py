"""Discord bot configuration module.

This module contains the configuration settings for the Discord bot application. 
It includes settings for the application name, wait time, channel IDs, bot token, 
API keys, messages in English and Japanese, API URL, and a flag to include sources.

The settings are defined in the DiscordAppConfig class, which inherits from the 
BaseSettings class provided by the pydantic_settings package. The settings values 
are either hardcoded or fetched from environment variables.

Typical usage example:

  config = DiscordAppConfig()
  wait_time = config.WAIT_TIME
  bot_token = config.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
